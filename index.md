### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    One of my favorite labs was this one, which was our first. This lab consisted of three sections; lab 1 dealt with converting Fahrenheit to celsius. cc. The second section covered the quadratic formula.cc quadratic equation solving program. The program that prints "Hello World" was the third component of the lab. Part 2 of the lab was my favorite section. This lab was one of our first tasks, and I finally got to utilize C++, so I really like it. I thoroughly appreciated it because I was eager to see it. Peer programming appealed to me, and I enjoyed working with my lab partner on this project. I was astounded to discover how if statements function in a program after learning how to utilize them. Through using

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 included three components. Finding palindromes in a file was the focus of the lab's first section. Saving messages was the focus of the lab's second section. We learned how to program an animated pumpkin in the third lab session. Making the program for part 3 of this lab, where the Halloween pumpkin ran on the terminal, was my favorite part of the exercise. Even though dealing with palindromes was really challenging at first but was ultimately successful, I also really enjoyed that portion of the lab. I acquired the ability to use files in my programs. I figured out how to see if a file is open. I discovered how to save user input data.

* Lab 11

    There were two components to Lab 12. Making gradient animations was the focus of the lab's initial section. The second section discussed lovely noises. The creation of animation components and the beautiful results made the first section of the lab one of my favorites. I also learned how to use try and catch, which was initially difficult to understand but was ultimately beneficial.
